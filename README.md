## Digital tools used
1. QuizN
- The first tool is 'quizn' to check what you have learned. It allows students who participate in the quiz show to feel the fun and immersion of the competition through real-time ranking and checking the results. It is easy to access because it does not require separate membership and log in to solve the quiz. Students' understanding can be checked numerically, and lively sound effects and characters are applied so that they can enjoy fun quiz games. Since students' answers appear in numbers, teachers can know what is lacking and students can immediately check the wrong questions and make up for them. This allows students to learn more about the unit because they can create their own questions. It is used to check whether students understand the content well after a unit is finished and what they have learned is organized.

2. Grammarly
- The second tool is Grammarly. In the previous teaching method, the teacher unilaterally planned learning and controlled the class. This has the aspect of helping students with their learning activities rather than guiding them. Therefore, recently, the subject of learning is required to move from teacher to student, and using Grammarly allows students to recognize and correct grammar errors on their own. Through this process, the existing traditional teaching method can be supplemented. If an error occurs while students are writing, the error cannot be corrected if the teacher does not recognize it, but Grammarly not only gives you time, but also allows you to correct and learn from time to time, so you can learn continuously and efficiently.
