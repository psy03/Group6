## Title
Improving students' English skills through song production activities


## Target
Middle school students

## Meeting
### 4/9 (first meeting)
|Meeting Content|We looked for textbooks that are actually used in middle schools to understand _the current curriculum_ of middle education. We looked for tools that could make the learning more interesting for the students and help them in terms of efficiency.|
|Selected Digital Tools|Suno, Grammarly|




## Digital tools used  *__각자 사진 첨부 필요__*
 QuizN
- The first tool is 'quizn' to check what you have learned. It allows students who participate in the quiz show to feel the fun and immersion of the competition through real-time ranking and checking the results. 
- It is used to check whether students understand the content well after a unit is finished and what they have learned is organized.

 Grammarly
- 'Grammarly' is an online document correction tool that helps improve the quality of grammar, spelling, syntax, and expression. Additionally, it assists users in enhancing their writing skills by identifying mistakes and providing recommendations while composing their text. Through this, students can produce more accurate and professional documents.

## Digital Tools Selection Reasons 
__QuizN__
1) It is easy to access because it does not require separate membership and log in to solve the quiz. 
2) Students' understanding can be checked numerically, and lively sound effects and characters are applied so that they can enjoy fun quiz games. 
3) Since students' answers appear in numbers, teachers can know what is lacking and students can immediately check the wrong questions and make up for them. 
4) This allows students to learn more about the unit because they can create their own questions.


__Grammarly__
1) Clear and polished communication makes educational materials more accessible to all students, including those with learning disabilities or English as a second language.  
2) 'Grammarly' provides feedback on students' writing, highlighting areas for improvement and offering suggestions for enhancement. 
3) Utilizing AI for personalized, one-on-one modifications optimizes time allocation, fostering tailored educational experiences. 
4) 'Grammarly' allows you to correct grammar errors on your own.


__Suno__
1) students can break away from memorizing classes and strengthen their abilities through singing. 
2) The activity of using a given amount of time to perform assignments enables students to achieve a sense of accomplishment.
3) The memory of musical rhythms remains much more pronounced in students' head, and it is also easy to induce interest.
4)  Learning through music helps relieve boredom and helps people who do not have any English or musical skills to learn in a more comfortable atmosphere.
5)  Repetitive practice, which is essential for English class progress, becomes possible through the use of Suno. Students can also develop listening and speaking skills by listening to and singing songs repeatedly.


## Tool Utilization Class Preview

## The limitations and complementary points of teaching methods
1) There may be a tendency to overly rely on 'Grammarly'.
2) Occasionally, errors may occur in 'Grammarly' due to its failure to grasp contextual nuances, resulting in unintended alterations in students' writing.
3) The process of creating song lyrics demands creativity, which may lead students to feel burdened and encounter difficulties.
4) Students who are unfamiliar with digital tools such as 'Suno' or 'Grammarly' may face challenges.

- The potential for unnecessary consumption of class time and potential delays in lesson progression due to the aforementioned factors underscores the importance of proper time allocation. Additionally, providing students with advance instructions on how to effectively utilize the tools is imperative.
- The process of informing students about the content that must be included in song lyrics from the lessons and the contents that needs to be reviewed is necessary.


## Enhanced Lesson Process
1. Study one chapter
2. Summarize the learned content
3. Verify the learned content through QuizN
4. Reiterate key content essential for songs
5. Form teams of 4-5 members
6. Create song lyrics using learned content

- Applying the aforementioned improvement, we have incorporated the 'QuizN' program into the learning process. This decision was made considering its usefulness in engaging students with various types of quizzes, and allowing teachers to review individual student answers, thus enhancing overall effectiveness.
