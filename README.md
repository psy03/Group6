## 2. Digital Tools Selection Reasons
1) It is easy to access because it does not require separate membership and log in to solve the quiz. 
2) Students' understanding can be checked numerically, and lively sound effects and characters are applied so that they can enjoy fun quiz games. 
3) Since students' answers appear in numbers, teachers can know what is lacking and students can immediately check the wrong questions and make up for them. 
4) This allows students to learn more about the unit because they can create their own questions.
