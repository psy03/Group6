## Digital tools used
1. QuizN
- The first tool is 'quizn' to check what you have learned. It allows students who participate in the quiz show to feel the fun and immersion of the competition through real-time ranking and checking the results. 
- It is used to check whether students understand the content well after a unit is finished and what they have learned is organized.

1) It is easy to access because it does not require separate membership and log in to solve the quiz. 
2) Students' understanding can be checked numerically, and lively sound effects and characters are applied so that they can enjoy fun quiz games. 
3) Since students' answers appear in numbers, teachers can know what is lacking and students can immediately check the wrong questions and make up for them. 
4) This allows students to learn more about the unit because they can create their own questions. 

2. Grammarly
- The second tool is Grammarly. In the previous teaching method, the teacher unilaterally planned learning and controlled the class. This has the aspect of helping students with their learning activities rather than guiding them. Therefore, recently, the subject of learning is required to move from teacher to student, and using Grammarly allows students to recognize and correct grammar errors on their own. Through this process, the existing traditional teaching method can be supplemented. If an error occurs while students are writing, the error cannot be corrected if the teacher does not recognize it, but Grammarly not only gives you time, but also allows you to correct and learn from time to time, so you can learn continuously and efficiently.

3. Suno
- Suno is a website that produces songs in a short time when topics, words, and sentences are written and put in. You can also download the songs that have been made. "Music is vital to everyone's character building. All children should receive musical training." Based on Festaloch's teaching principles, students can break away from memorizing classes and strengthen their abilities through singing. 
The activity of using a given amount of time to perform assignments enables children to achieve a sense of accomplishment. In addition, the memory of musical rhythms remains much more pronounced in one's head, and it is also easy to induce interest. 
Learning through music helps relieve boredom and helps people who do not have any English or musical skills to learn in a more comfortable atmosphere. In addition, repetitive practice, which is essential for English class progress, becomes possible through the use of Suno. You can also develop listening and speaking skills by listening to and singing songs repeatedly.
