 QuizN
- The first tool is 'quizn' to check what you have learned. It allows students who participate in the quiz show to feel the fun and immersion of the competition through real-time ranking and checking the results. 
- It is used to check whether students understand the content well after a unit is finished and what they have learned is organized.


 Grammarly
- 'Grammarly' is an online document correction tool that helps improve the quality of grammar, spelling, syntax, and expression. Additionally, it assists users in enhancing their writing skills by identifying mistakes and providing recommendations while composing their text. Through this, students can produce more accurate and professional documents.


 Suno
- Suno is a website that produces songs in a short time when topics, words, and sentences are written and put in. You can also download the songs that have been made.

## Digital Tools Selection Reasons
QuizN
1) It is easy to access because it does not require separate membership and log in to solve the quiz. 
2) Students' understanding can be checked numerically, and lively sound effects and characters are applied so that they can enjoy fun quiz games. 
3) Since students' answers appear in numbers, teachers can know what is lacking and students can immediately check the wrong questions and make up for them. 
4) This allows students to learn more about the unit because they can create their own questions.


Grammarly
1) Clear and polished communication makes educational materials more accessible to all students, including those with learning disabilities or English as a second language.  
2) 'Grammarly' provides feedback on students' writing, highlighting areas for improvement and offering suggestions for enhancement. 
3) Utilizing AI for personalized, one-on-one modifications optimizes time allocation, fostering tailored educational experiences. 
4) 'Grammarly' allows you to correct grammar errors on your own.


Suno
1) students can break away from memorizing classes and strengthen their abilities through singing. 
2) The activity of using a given amount of time to perform assignments enables students to achieve a sense of accomplishment.
3) The memory of musical rhythms remains much more pronounced in students' head, and it is also easy to induce interest.
4)  Learning through music helps relieve boredom and helps people who do not have any English or musical skills to learn in a more comfortable atmosphere.
5)  Repetitive practice, which is essential for English class progress, becomes possible through the use of Suno. Students can also develop listening and speaking skills by listening to and singing songs repeatedly.
